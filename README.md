# Overview of project

# Project
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to use unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, to reveal natural groupings within an unlabeled dataset. By identifying clusters, the goal is to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that provide a deeper understanding of the data's structure. This project also aims to evaluate the effectiveness of each clustering method using metrics such as silhouette score and Davies–Bouldin index, and to visualize the clusters, offering insights into distinct segments or subpopulations within the data. These insights can support data-driven decisions and further analysis.

**Key Activities**
1.Data Preprocessing:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features and distributions.
2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation:
Apply clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN).
Tune parameters for each clustering algorithm (e.g., number of clusters in K-means, distance threshold in hierarchical clustering, and epsilon and minimum samples in DBSCAN).
3.Visualization:
Visualize clustering results with methods such as scatter plots, dendrograms (for hierarchical clustering), and dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to project high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D space.
4.Documentation and Reporting:
Document findings, methodology, and interpretations for each clustering approach.

**Technologies Used**

1.Python: Programming language used for implementation.
2.Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
3.Scikit-Learn: For clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) and evaluation metrics (silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index).
4.SciPy: For hierarchical clustering and dendrogram visualization.
5.Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualization of clustering results and EDA.
6.PCA / t-SNE: For dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters in lower dimensions.
